## Password cracking

So for this assignment we were given the task to crack a few hashed passwords using hashid to figure out the hash type and hashcat to crack the passwords.
I began to do the assignment just how it was shown in this article (https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/?fromSearch=password%20hash)
and for some reason it just kept giving me an error and after sometime I found out the error might not be in me this time but that hashcat might just have compatibility
issues with my current processor. Here is the picture of the errors there was actually 2 types of errors:
