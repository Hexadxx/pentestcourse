# Penetration Testing Course repository

Repository for Penetration test course in Haaga-Helia by Tero Karvinen

# H0 First assignment

The first assignment given is to analyze web traffic

## Starting point

Before the start of assignment Tero suggested to use Wireshark for this as it is one of the best free software to check on web traffic and as I have it and little bit of starting knowledge to use it I decided to use it for this assignment.

## First impressions on Wireshark

When first opened Wireshark there is no pop ups or anything that could be considered an annoyance which is good and the front page is very clean here is a picture of how it looks like

It basically shows all the adapters and such that are connected to a network on your computer

## WireShark Showcase

So what I did is I opened up the interface for my current internet connection and opened up my browser to get some traffic for my internet connection (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are blurred out for security reasons)

So what am I supposed to tell by this information? Well basically I can see what kind of traffic I have going on within my network connection, where am I connected to and what type of protocol is the connection using.

# H1 First Homework

## First Assignment (x)

For the first assignment we were told to choose either an episode from herrasmieshakkerit podcast or Darknet Diaries and make a summary from that episode. First I checked out Darknet Diaries and immediately noticed episode 125 which was an interview with Jeremiah Roe about how he and his team had attempted to break into a company building for penetration testing which immedietaly made me choose it, because after all this is a penetration testing course. At first I was a little bit confused as it had started with an interview with a man called Michael Fagan and about how he broke into the buckingham palace incredibly easily. The interview lasted for about 10 minutes and it was quite interesting but then they moved into the actual interview with Jeremiah Roe. The interview started with explaining a little bit about Jeremiahs history and how he ended up in doing penetration testing at a contractor for the government that he worked for. Over the course of the interview they went over, well firstly how he even ended up to do the operation, what was the point for him to do so, which was to test if it was possible by someone with malicious intent to penetrate into that building, how to get access into data or even get access to even deeper into the government through that contractor organization and simply see how hard it would be. Jeremiah explained how he worked for Washington DC-based contractor that did a lot of work for the federal government, and since there were offices scattered in remote locations he then went on about how foreign countries don't always try to get into the governments networks, but instead go through contractors, since contractors do work for the government, they have to have some connection to government networks. So he explained all of the steps he had to do to do to test if this office was vulnerable or not.

Overall this interview was incredibly interesting, it gave a lot of insight in what penetration testing actually is and shows how a small and simple hole in security can be torn open and turn into a massive problem, and this is why penetration testing is vital for companies and especially government, so there is less chance of getting breached by malicious intruders.

## Second Assignment (a)

The next assignment was to install WebGoat and to test I can login on to it so first I installed Kali Linux virtual machine so I started by going to google and look up where to get the file to install a Kali linux virtual machine and found https://www.kali.org/ which is the home page for Kali linux so I downloaded Kali linux for virtualbox. I opened the folder, extracted it to desktop and double-clicked the "kali-linux-2022.3-virtualbox-amd64.vbox" file which automatically made a virtual machine on VirtualBox. Next I opened the virtual machine and the guide to install WebGoat 8 by Tero Karvinen (https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/)
Next up I ran the command to install Java and other useful tools like ufw firewall and wget
> sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-11-jre ufw wget bash-completion

To download WebGoat I ran the command:

> wget https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

and

> java -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

to run the server

Next I opened the link http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/ on the browser and registered a user successfully
