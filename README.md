# Penetration Testing Course repository

Repository for Penetration test course in Haaga-Helia by Tero Karvinen

# H0 First assignment

The first assignment given is to analyze web traffic

## Starting point

Before the start of assignment Tero suggested to use Wireshark for this as it is one of the best free software to check on web traffic and as I have it and little bit of starting knowledge to use it I decided to use it for this assignment.

## First impressions on Wireshark

When first opened Wireshark there is no pop ups or anything that could be considered an annoyance which is good and the front page is very clean.

It basically shows all the adapters and such that are connected to a network on your computer

## WireShark Showcase

So what I did is I opened up the interface for my current internet connection and opened up my browser to get some traffic for my internet connection (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are blurred out for security reasons)

So what am I supposed to tell by this information? Well basically I can see what kind of traffic I have going on within my network connection, where am I connected to and what type of protocol is the connection using.

# H1 First Homework

## First Assignment (x)

For the first assignment we were told to choose either an episode from herrasmieshakkerit podcast or Darknet Diaries and make a summary from that episode. First I checked out Darknet Diaries and immediately noticed episode 125 which was an interview with Jeremiah Roe about how he and his team had attempted to break into a company building for penetration testing which immedietaly made me choose it, because after all this is a penetration testing course. At first I was a little bit confused as it had started with an interview with a man called Michael Fagan and about how he broke into the buckingham palace incredibly easily. The interview lasted for about 10 minutes and it was quite interesting but then they moved into the actual interview with Jeremiah Roe. The interview started with explaining a little bit about Jeremiahs history and how he ended up in doing penetration testing at a contractor for the government that he worked for. Over the course of the interview they went over, well firstly how he even ended up to do the operation, what was the point for him to do so, which was to test if it was possible by someone with malicious intent to penetrate into that building, how to get access into data or even get access to even deeper into the government through that contractor organization and simply see how hard it would be. Jeremiah explained how he worked for Washington DC-based contractor that did a lot of work for the federal government, and since there were offices scattered in remote locations he then went on about how foreign countries don't always try to get into the governments networks, but instead go through contractors, since contractors do work for the government, they have to have some connection to government networks. So he explained all of the steps he had to do to do to test if this office was vulnerable or not.

Overall this interview was incredibly interesting, it gave a lot of insight in what penetration testing actually is and shows how a small and simple hole in security can be torn open and turn into a massive problem, and this is why penetration testing is vital for companies and especially government, so there is less chance of getting breached by malicious intruders.

## Second Assignment (a)

The next assignment was to install WebGoat and to test I can login on to it so first I installed Kali Linux virtual machine so I started by going to google and look up where to get the file to install a Kali linux virtual machine and found https://www.kali.org/ which is the home page for Kali linux so I downloaded Kali linux for virtualbox. I opened the folder, extracted it to desktop and double-clicked the "kali-linux-2022.3-virtualbox-amd64.vbox" file which automatically made a virtual machine on VirtualBox. Next I opened the virtual machine and the guide to install WebGoat 8 by Tero Karvinen (https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/)
Next up I ran the command to install Java and other useful tools like ufw firewall and wget
> sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-11-jre ufw wget bash-completion

To download WebGoat I ran the command:

> wget https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

and

> java -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

to run the server

Next I opened the link http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/ on the browser and registered a user successfully

## Third Assignment (b)

For the third assignment we were tasked to do the "HTTP Basics" and "Developer Tools" on WebGoat that we just finished installing and registering into. So HTTP Basics started by explaining how HTTP works. Next it literally shows how http can handle requests, so it tells you to input your name then press go and it reverses the name. For the last thing I was supposed to figure out the magic number, and there was even a tip to how to do it, but it required to install a program called "OWASP Zap" as it was suggested to be used. To download it I looked up a way and finally found a video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-jcs7Cm-iE". I installed OWASP Zap, but could not make it to actually accomplish to get anything so I figured out how to find the answer through the browsers own console and figured it out so in the console there is the file "attack2" I click into it and choose "Request" and it showed me the answer (picture as a reference)

So the answer was 90 instead of the 525 I first input and after I put 90 instead of 525 it gave me this response:

We were also told to finish the "Developer Tools" which started with explaining how you might need the developer tools for future assignments and what the different tabs are used for. The assignment says it's focusing on Google Chrome Developer Tools but you can use any other browser with developer tools so I decided to stay with Firefox. The first actual assignment on was to call a function

> webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()

with this function I got the response "phone homsaid {"lessonCompleted":true,"feedback":"Congratulations. You have succesfully completed the assignment.","output":"phoneHome Response is -1422190049"} and I was to type the number I received from the response into the textbox and after submitting it was completed.

As the next and last assignment for developer tools I was tasked with finding a specific HTTP request and read a randomized number from it. As this task was very similar to the magic number task from HTTP Basics ths was incredibly simple I press the button to get the request, find the correct HTTP request that contains a field "networkNum:", copied the number to the text box and verified it was the correct number.

## Fourth Assignment (c)

For this assignment the goal was to finish the levels 0-2 from Over The Wire bandit wargame.

First thing you is easy. All you have to do is connect to the host "bandit.labs.overthewire.org" on port "2220" the user and password is "bandit0". First level was to find the password to the next level which was in a readme file located in home directory. Just to make sure the file is there i used the command **ls** to list everything within that directory and there it was the readme file. I opened the file with the text editor "nano" with command **nano readme** and copied the password to the clipboard. Next I restarted putty to login to "bandit1" with the newly acquired password. To get to level 3 the password was located in a file called - which can be tricky since you can not just peek into a file with that kind of name. So I googled how to do it and came across this website (https://www.webservertalk.com/dashed-filename) and all I had to do was to use command cat which basically shows the contets of a file or files with a specification < between the command and the file name like "cat < -" and it printed the password for me.

## The fifth assignment (d)

Surprisingly it was just to install Kali linux wihich I already did and explained in the first assignment for the WebGoat.

## The sixth assignment (e)

This was the most challenging one out of them all as we were given the task to solve a problem from 2021 Challenge.fi.

It took me a while to figure out which challenge to do and decided to go with deciphering the challenge "Basic Ciphers 144". Reason to choose this one was simple, the hint told about ROT13 and while googling rot13 I came across a website called "rot13.com" and just tried dropping the flag there and surprise surprise it deciphered the flag and the result was "FLAG{well_this_was_easy}"
