# Penetration Testing Course repository

Repository for Penetration test course in Haaga-Helia by Tero Karvinen

# H0 First assignment

The first assignment given is to analyze web traffic

## Starting point

Before the start of assignment Tero suggested to use Wireshark for this as it is one of the best free software to check on web traffic and as I have it and little bit of starting knowledge to use it I decided to use it for this assignment.

## First impressions on Wireshark

When first opened Wireshark there is no pop ups or anything that could be considered an annoyance which is good and the front page is very clean.

It basically shows all the adapters and such that are connected to a network on your computer

## WireShark Showcase

So what I did is I opened up the interface for my current internet connection and opened up my browser to get some traffic for my internet connection (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are blurred out for security reasons)

So what am I supposed to tell by this information? Well basically I can see what kind of traffic I have going on within my network connection, where am I connected to and what type of protocol is the connection using.

# H1 First Homework

## First Assignment (x)

For the first assignment we were told to choose either an episode from herrasmieshakkerit podcast or Darknet Diaries and make a summary from that episode. First I checked out Darknet Diaries and immediately noticed episode 125 which was an interview with Jeremiah Roe about how he and his team had attempted to break into a company building for penetration testing which immedietaly made me choose it, because after all this is a penetration testing course. At first I was a little bit confused as it had started with an interview with a man called Michael Fagan and about how he broke into the buckingham palace incredibly easily. The interview lasted for about 10 minutes and it was quite interesting but then they moved into the actual interview with Jeremiah Roe. The interview started with explaining a little bit about Jeremiahs history and how he ended up in doing penetration testing at a contractor for the government that he worked for. Over the course of the interview they went over, well firstly how he even ended up to do the operation, what was the point for him to do so, which was to test if it was possible by someone with malicious intent to penetrate into that building, how to get access into data or even get access to even deeper into the government through that contractor organization and simply see how hard it would be. Jeremiah explained how he worked for Washington DC-based contractor that did a lot of work for the federal government, and since there were offices scattered in remote locations he then went on about how foreign countries don't always try to get into the governments networks, but instead go through contractors, since contractors do work for the government, they have to have some connection to government networks. So he explained all of the steps he had to do to do to test if this office was vulnerable or not.

Overall this interview was incredibly interesting, it gave a lot of insight in what penetration testing actually is and shows how a small and simple hole in security can be torn open and turn into a massive problem, and this is why penetration testing is vital for companies and especially government, so there is less chance of getting breached by malicious intruders.

## Second Assignment (a)

The next assignment was to install WebGoat and to test I can login on to it so first I installed Kali Linux virtual machine so I started by going to google and look up where to get the file to install a Kali linux virtual machine and found https://www.kali.org/ which is the home page for Kali linux so I downloaded Kali linux for virtualbox. I opened the folder, extracted it to desktop and double-clicked the "kali-linux-2022.3-virtualbox-amd64.vbox" file which automatically made a virtual machine on VirtualBox. Next I opened the virtual machine and the guide to install WebGoat 8 by Tero Karvinen (https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/)
Next up I ran the command to install Java and other useful tools like ufw firewall and wget
> sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-11-jre ufw wget bash-completion

To download WebGoat I ran the command:

> wget https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

and

> java -jar webgoat-server-8.0.0.M26.jar

to run the server

Next I opened the link http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/ on the browser and registered a user successfully

## Third Assignment (b)

For the third assignment we were tasked to do the "HTTP Basics" and "Developer Tools" on WebGoat that we just finished installing and registering into. So HTTP Basics started by explaining how HTTP works. Next it literally shows how http can handle requests, so it tells you to input your name then press go and it reverses the name. For the last thing I was supposed to figure out the magic number, and there was even a tip to how to do it, but it required to install a program called "OWASP Zap" as it was suggested to be used. To download it I looked up a way and finally found a video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-jcs7Cm-iE". I installed OWASP Zap, but could not make it to actually accomplish to get anything so I figured out how to find the answer through the browsers own console and figured it out so in the console there is the file "attack2" I click into it and choose "Request" and it showed me the answer (picture as a reference)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/198859675-a89bcd99-18a8-45f2-a01e-92c9665b2516.png)

So the answer was 90 instead of the 525 I first input and after I put 90 instead of 525 it gave me this response:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/198859743-ba10f577-dccf-455b-8a59-38385791b4b5.png)

We were also told to finish the "Developer Tools" which started with explaining how you might need the developer tools for future assignments and what the different tabs are used for. The assignment says it's focusing on Google Chrome Developer Tools but you can use any other browser with developer tools so I decided to stay with Firefox. The first actual assignment on was to call a function

> webgoat.customjs.phoneHome()

with this function I got the response "phone homsaid {"lessonCompleted":true,"feedback":"Congratulations. You have succesfully completed the assignment.","output":"phoneHome Response is -1422190049"} and I was to type the number I received from the response into the textbox and after submitting it was completed.

As the next and last assignment for developer tools I was tasked with finding a specific HTTP request and read a randomized number from it. As this task was very similar to the magic number task from HTTP Basics ths was incredibly simple I press the button to get the request, find the correct HTTP request that contains a field "networkNum:", copied the number to the text box and verified it was the correct number.

## Fourth Assignment (c)

For this assignment the goal was to finish the levels 0-2 from Over The Wire bandit wargame.

First thing you is easy. All you have to do is connect to the host "bandit.labs.overthewire.org" on port "2220" the user and password is "bandit0". First level was to find the password to the next level which was in a readme file located in home directory. Just to make sure the file is there i used the command **ls** to list everything within that directory and there it was the readme file. I opened the file with the text editor "nano" with command **nano readme** and copied the password to the clipboard. Next I restarted putty to login to "bandit1" with the newly acquired password. To get to level 3 the password was located in a file called - which can be tricky since you can not just peek into a file with that kind of name. So I googled how to do it and came across this website (https://www.webservertalk.com/dashed-filename) and all I had to do was to use command cat which basically shows the contets of a file or files with a specification < between the command and the file name like "cat < -" and it printed the password for me.

## The fifth assignment (d)

Surprisingly it was just to install Kali linux wihich I already did and explained in the first assignment for the WebGoat.

## The sixth assignment (e)

This was the most challenging one out of them all as we were given the task to solve a problem from 2021 Challenge.fi.

It took me a while to figure out which challenge to do and decided to go with deciphering the challenge "Basic Ciphers 144". Reason to choose this one was simple, the hint told about ROT13 and while googling rot13 I came across a website called "rot13.com" and just tried dropping the flag there and surprise surprise it deciphered the flag and the result was "FLAG{well_this_was_easy}"

# H2 Homework

## First Assignment (x)

So for this assignment we were given a part of an article (Jaswal 2020: Mastering Metasploit - 4ed: Chapter 1: [Approaching a Penetration Test Using Metasploit](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-metasploit-/9781838980078/B15076_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-30)) starting from "Conducting a penetration test with Metasploit" and read it all the way to the end and give a summary of the article.

### First

The article from the the given spot started with telling about the basic terms and commands used in metasploit

### Second

It mentions that if you are using Metasploit for the very first time you should check out their [Wiki](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki )

### Third

It explains the benefits of using Metasploit over just different tools and scripts

### Fourth

The article then goes on to how explains how to actually do an exercise of penetration testing with Metasploit

### Finally

It did say to summarize the text but also some videos but there was no videos at least to me so there was nothing to summarize on that.

## Second Assignment (a)

This assignment was to install Metasploitable 2 and install it into an isolated network with the attacking virtual machine. This is mostly based on my memory as I did this assignment already during the lecture.

### First things first

The attacking machine I used for this was a clone from a Kali Linux virtual machine I had previously installed ([here](https://github.com/Hexadxx/pentestcourse#second-assignment-a)). For the metasploitable 2 I first visited the original [website](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/) to acquire the file. 

### Creating the Metasploitable machine

I created a new fresh Debian virtual machine but replaced the virtual hard disk with the Metasploitable file which turns the virtual machine into a metasploitable machine. 

### Setting up the network

Instead of immediately launching the metasploitable I went on to create a local network on VirtualBox which would be used to connect the attacking machine and the Metasploitable machine in the same network but to make it so it is not connected to the internet. For this I used this [article](https://carleton.ca/scs/2019/creating-a-new-host-only-adapter-in-virtualbox/) I found on google and then I set both the attacking machine and the Metasploitable one into the same isolated network.

## Third Assignment (b)

For this assignment we were told to do a port scan for our Metasploitable 2 machine and analyze the results. For this assignment I found a really nice video that shows how to do a simple port scan with Nmap or goes a little bit deeper with a tool called "Armitage" that is pre installed on Kali Linux but I decided to just stick with the default Nmap scan with terminal. I started with first getting the ip of my Metasploitable machine by typing ifconfig on the Metasploitable machine:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200136610-5484560a-8c78-4257-b90f-ae996d2337ac.png)

Next I just opened up my attacking machine and since it is Kali Linux, Nmap is already pre-installed on the machine so I opened up terminal and just scanned the ports with the command "nmap 192.168.56.5" Here is the result:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200136756-409caa67-2ebc-41d8-af24-f46e490caf8a.png)

The assignment also told us to use different techniques like banner grabbing or NSE. So before this lecture I was not aware of what these things were so after a quick googling I found out that banner grabbing is about collecting data from target system ([source](https://www.hackingarticles.in/multiple-ways-to-banner-grabbing/)). NSE aka Nmap Scripting Engine is a way for users to write and share simple scripts to automate a wide variety of network tasks ([source](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html)). So I decided to try banner grabbing and used NetCat for it which grabs the protocol version here is 2 examples from ports 21 and 22: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200150045-4f7e636e-afc8-4cb5-9ff0-265af3ca3632.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200150051-83a4a204-b680-449d-b807-8abc37443393.png)

So basically from all of this I concluded that with these tools you cand find out the ports that are open which can possibly be exploited and use to gain access to the computer.

Finally to wrap this assignment we were told to save the port scan results in metasploit database and files. To figure this out I googled about it and found a good [article](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/using-databases/) about it. So as mentioned in the article you need to start postgresql on your attacking Kali machine to use the database so I start the service with

> systemctl start postgresql

After postgresql is started I initialized the database with the command

> sudo msfdb init

and as there is no database it will create one. Here is a picture apparently in the article it says msfdb init is enough but it said it requires to be run as root:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200152190-bbbc494b-6703-4d3e-85cf-f8705e276b50.png)

To test the database is connected to metasploit I checked by first running msfconsole and using the command:

>  db_status

and receiving the result: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200152539-eae941a9-9e3b-4b1d-a135-83e726a1799c.png)

Then to do a port scan and importing to database I decided to use a workspace to keep it clean. So first I made a workspace with the command: 

> workspace -a msfu

then opened the workspace with the command "workspace msfu" to test this I just ran the command workspace which shows your current workspace.
Now to do an import I first ran a db_nmap 192.168.56.5 to run a port scan that can be imported to the database then import it to the workspace. After trying to import the port scan into the database it says db_import command not found. Okay I resolved so it seems when doing the port scan you have to add --save at the end of the command so it saves it to a file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200177791-295a728b-ee3d-4ffc-9889-1e7199fc3652.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200177807-bf53a608-b592-4627-b9e7-abe3bc1c573d.png)

Next I just copied the path of the .xml file path and imported it to database with the command:

> db_import (file-path) 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77589513/200178092-9e8abb5d-34b2-42ce-8d4d-3ade670f9f6b.png)

## Fourth Assignment (c)
For this assignment we were told to break into the metasploitable machine so i looked up how to do that in the google. I found this really good article which goes on about how to find the exploits and how to break into the metasploitable machine.
