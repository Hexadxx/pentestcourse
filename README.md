Repository for Penetration test course in Haaga-Helia by Tero Karvinen

## H0 First assignment

The first assignment given is to analyze web traffic

## Starting point

Before the start of assignment Tero suggested to use Wireshark for this as it is one of the best free software to check on web traffic and as I have it and little bit of starting knowledge to use it I decided to use it for this assignment.

## First impressions on Wireshark

When first opened Wireshark there is no pop ups or anything that could be considered an annoyance which is good and the front page is very clean here is a picture of how it looks like

It basically shows all the adapters and such that are connected to a network on your computer

## WireShark Showcase

So what I did is I opened up the interface for my current internet connection and opened up my browser to get some traffic for my internet connection (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are blurred out for security reasons)

So what am I supposed to tell by this information? Well basically I can see what kind of traffic I have going on within my network connection, where am I connected to and what type of protocol is the connection using.
